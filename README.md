# Pomodoro-Timer
Proposed Concept
     1. The conventional methodology recommends a 25 minute pomodoro and a 5 minute
         break.  
     2. Every 4 pomodoros will be rewarded with a 20-30 minute break.  
     3. time is the time stamp at which the corresponding pomodoro ended. (This file might be helpful 
         in plotting a graph on productivity.) 
     4. The timer is capable of notifying the user when the pomodoro ends using  a dialog box
